## Definition

The term observability finds its origins in control theory, where it refers to the ability to infer a function of the system state from the output. (Krauss et al., 2025). 

Within software, this definition is adapted as "visibility into the behavior, performance and health of the layers within a software ecosystem". This ecosystem can encompass everything from user interfaces to backend services, databases, infrastructures and the networks that connect them. (Kisina et al., 2021)

For example, observability within networking might mean the following:
- monitoring the health  and reachability of individual components, such as routers and switches
- logging incoming requests
- following important metrics - network speed, packet time-to-live (TTL), data loss across the network

Combined with effective alerting (further described in chapter TODO), this can lead to early detection of anomalous behavior - packet loss in a certain part of the network might indicate faulty equipment, massive increase in incoming requests might point to an incoming distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.




## DevOps

The field that has come to be best associated with ensuring observability and monitoring is called Site Reliability Engineering, also known as SRE. The origins of this term can be traced to Google, where the first SRE team was established in 2003. (Treynor, 2014)

Historically, software development used to be split into Development and Operations (shortened to Dev and Ops respectively). While Dev was tasked with creating new features for the software and updating them, the actual deployment to the servers and their ongoing maintenance was left to Ops. This has caused a fracture or outright resentment between the teams, who viewed each other as enemies, rather than colleagues working towards a common goal.
