**_Recommendations for the preparation of thesis at FIS_**

**_THE BLUE TEXT IS NOT PART OF THE THESIS AND MUST BE DELETED BEFORE SUBMISSION_****_._**

_The following thesis recommendations (hereinafter referred to as "recommendations") are intended to evaluate the defensibility of the thesis. They are intended for all types of theses in all Bachelor's and Master's degree programmes. They are not a substitute for thesis evaluations. If the committee considers the thesis undefensible, it should argue that an item in these recommendations has not been met._

**_Work done_**

- _The student has carried out professional work in the field of his/her study programme (including interdisciplinary areas)._
- _The final thesis demonstrates the student's orientation in the chosen field and his/her ability to define and achieve the chosen goal in this field._
- _The student has done professional work of a workload in the range of months._

**_Objectives and context_**

- _The text of the thesis describes the background - the expert context on which the student is based - the situation in professional knowledge or the situation in a specific application case._
- _The starting points contain only the findings that have an impact on the results of the thesis._
- _The text of the thesis clearly describes the aim of the thesis; if the aim is to solve a problem, the problem is sufficiently defined._
- _The reasonableness of the objectives in relation to the baseline is argued._
- _The specificity of the main objective is argued in the text - it is not a generic problem, which has been solved in the same way many times._
- _The formulation of the aim refers to a professional problem, not to the text of the thesis itself, to the reader or to the author. Thus, the objective is not formulated as "to write a text", "to communicate to the reader", "to describe the issue", "to explain", "to become familiar with the literature in the field", etc._
- _The text of the thesis is professional, not popular science. It solves a professional (practical or theoretical) problem._

**_Methodology_**

- _The text of the final thesis describes the process by which the student worked, separately from the results._
- _The procedure is described in steps, from which you can estimate their laboriousness._
- _The procedure lists all the work the student has done. If there are steps in the procedure that the student has not done, they are clearly marked as such (and the reason is given)._
- _The procedure is described in such a way that if someone else followed it, they would get similar results as the student._
- _The procedure is described in concrete terms, not just using generic names of thought processes such as analysis, deduction, synthesis, etc._
- _If the procedure used follows established methods described in the literature, it is not necessary to explain their operation in detail. However, the student should justify his/her choice of methods used or describe the deviations of the actual procedure from the established methods._

**_Results_**

- _The results demonstrate that the student has carried out expert work in the field of the study programme (including interdisciplinary areas)._
- _From the wording of the text of the final thesis it is clear what is the original result of the student, what is a fact taken from sources and what is speculation or discussion of results._
- _The text describes and interprets the results according to the procedure._
- _The text describes the partial results as outputs of the individual steps. Less important results are presented in the appendices, so that the text remains clear._
- _It is documented that the individual steps (e.g. calculations, descriptive statistics, interview records, program code, researcher's diary, etc.) have been performed, e.g. by uploading attachments to InSIS._
- _The text of the thesis describes the scientific results in a logical flow of argumentation._

**_Conclusions_**

- _Conclusions assess the degree to which the objective has been met._
- _The conclusions argue how the results have contributed to solving the problem._
- _Conclusions describe the possible impact of the results on the context (situation in the professional environment or in a specific application case), e.g. possible further work._
- _The conclusions mention possible limitations of the results obtained._

**_Originality_**

- _All adopted, translated or paraphrased texts are properly marked and cited in accordance with citation standard APA 7 (we recommend using the Zotero citation tool)._
- _In the case of the use of automatic text generation tools, this is in accordance with the rules and methodological recommendations of the Prague University of Economics and Business._
- _The text of the thesis cites and paraphrases only the sources that were used to solve the problem or define the context._
- _The text of the thesis does not unnecessarily recapitulate obvious theoretical knowledge (e.g. from the basic courses of the study programme)._
- _In exceptional cases, if the student did not work completely alone, the collaborators (company, academic) and the student's contribution to their performance are indicated at each step of the procedure or in the form of a table in an appendix._

**_Form_**

- _The text of the thesis is written as a coherent structured text, as paragraphs divided into chapters, in a structure suitable for the problem addressed._
- _Pages, tables, figures, appendices (etc.) are numbered._
- _Tables, figures, appendices, program code (etc.) that are not referenced from the body of the text do not appear in the thesis._
- _The format of the thesis is in accordance with the recommendations available on the FIS intranet for students._
- _The final thesis may take the form of a scientific article. In this case, it may be accompanied by an explanatory introduction (e.g. description of the journal, review process, co-authorship of the thesis supervisor, etc.)._

**_Additional_** **_requirements for the thesis_**

·         _The diploma thesis significantly deepens the field of knowledge in the given topic._

·         _The thesis clearly specifies the author's own contribution, which is in line with the objectives of the thesis._

·         _It is necessary to validate the results of the thesis (e.g. comparison of the results obtained with the literature, mathematical proof, structured interviews with interest groups, exact testing/measurement of results, etc.)._

**_Specifics of team theses_**

- _The fact that the thesis will be carried out in a team must be stated in the Thesis Assignment stored in InSIS and therefore approved by the thesis supervisor and the guarantor of the study programme (specialisation)._
- _Each student in the team submits an individual thesis, which is individually assessed, individually defended and evaluated. Each student is responsible for the entire text of the thesis._
- _Only a small part of the thesis may be shared in cases approved by the thesis advisor. More than 70% of the thesis is individual._
- _The artifacts produced by the team should be published in Git or on the project wiki, for example, and referenced by the authors of the thesis._
- _Each thesis completed by the team includes an appendix entitled Team Members' Contribution to the Result._
